::: {#about-section}

I'm a student of everything. Formally, an IC design researcher in University of the Philippines Diliman Microlab where I recently obtained my Master's degree in August 2025.

My primary research interest is in the creation of efficient computational systems in software and hardware for the advancement of both engineering (*low power computation on the edge, brain-computer interfaces*) and sciences (*device physics, emergent dynamics*).

### Secondary Interests

- Open source hardware everything. Why can't we have massive Github portfolios of random hardware? (We can)
- The Linux Kernel for RISCV
- The very very secret GPU architectures
- Applications of Abstract Math (surprisingly cool)
- Trying to understand AdS/CFT by Maldacena. Currently still in GR and QFT. 
- Learning an NVIM workflow, primarily because I'm tired of using VNC.
