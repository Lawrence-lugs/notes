# OK LETS DISCUSS THE SYLLABUS

## Diagnostic Quiz
# TREE
# DOG
# FAST
# BLUE
# STOVE
# WISH
# ICE
# LONG
# BEAUTIFUL
# KNEE
# RED
# HIGH
# LION
# FOOT
# DARK

## Checking

Grade separately **words pairs with blanks** and **word pairs that were given completely**.

Compare your final scores.

# TREE – LE__
# DOG – B__K
# FAST – RAPID
# BLUE – S__
# STOVE – HOT
# WISH – WANT
# ICE – C__D
# LONG – SHORT
# BEAUTIFUL – P__TTY
# KNEE – BEND
# RED – ROSE
# HIGH – L__
# LION – ROAR
# FOOT – SH__
# DARK – NIGHT
# LAMP – LI__T
# SLOW – TURTLE
# HARD – SO__
# WHITE – BL__K
# KING – CROWN

## Result 

You are **much more likely to have gotten the words with blanks CORRECT**.

- Words without blanks: You read and accept it.
- Words with blanks: You read, **think about what it is**, then you say "ok that makes sense".

What we just did is the same experiment in the seminal 1978 Learning Psychology paper *The Generation Effect*

## Pre-141 Study Tips

Per the statistics EEE 131 is objectively difficult. EEE 141 is also objectively difficult. 

But it doesn't have to be!

- Both of these were my favorite subjects!
- My grades were lowest at the start of undergrad, but slowly improved.
- The following are what I can remember were useful to me.

## Active Recall 

From the activity, we can take:

- **Writing down what you know** is better than reading the slides again.
- Practice filling a yellow pad with **EVERYTHING** you remember first, THEN reading the slides

This modifies your neural circuits not to just *familiarize*, but to be good at *recalling*.

## Familiarity $\neq$ Understanding

Quite often, you can find yourself having trouble with a problem *that you're supposed to know easily.* The following are likely cases of mistaking familiarity for understanding:

- *"I remember this lesson but I can't solve the problem"*
- *"The exam problems are too different from the slides"*

**In any case, it's better to have this problem BEFORE the exam.**

## Familiarity $\neq$ Understanding (2)

::: {.callout-note title="Bjork 2011"} 
Be aware, too, when rereading a chapter or your notes, that prior exposures create a **sense of familiarity** that can easily be confused with understanding.
:::

## Generate your own questions

- Actively think up questions about the subject matter during the class. Write it down.
*Why do electrons move up? Why is frequency response important? Do we really use coupling capacitors for everything? Does anyone ever use JUST a CE amplifier?*
- Create your own sample problems. If *you can make a sample problem, then you understand WHY we try to learn a specific lesson.* You have mastered the concept. This is true understanding.

## Generate your own questions (2)

I was always the annoying kid who kept his instructor in the classroom for about 15 minutes after class, asking about theoreticals.

- Please ask me questions after class. ANY question.

::: {.callout-tip}
Nowadays, chat AI can typically answer questions like these very easily as well!
:::

## Miscellaneous

- **Answer ALL the samplex you can**^[I used to go through a decade's worth of Math samplex in Ministop Maginhawa or ZenTea nung may pera na ko] ^[**WITHOUT** any solutions. Just answering.].
- **Study in various places**. This is known to be more effective^[Smith, Glenberg, & Bjork, 1978: I studied in Ministop Maginhawa and Zentea].
- **Interleave subjects!**. This is also known to be more effective than studying one at a time.^[Shea & Morgan, 1979 "Contextual Interference"]

## Sem-wide Bonus

### [Handout Generation](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17IF0q8iyh3DJ43dXVcnXQfpiLbjzbJopYsxsAWsKsdo/edit?usp=sharing)

Create a handout version of the slides for a specific lesson in EEE 141.

Use [stackedit](https://stackedit.io/app#) or your any Markdown editor (notepad works) to create the handout.

Sign up for a specific lesson in the link above.

One (complete) handout is worth one bonus handler grade point. (1% of grade) - note that this is about as much as a single homework.

# appendix

## Feynman Biography

::: {.callout-note title="From The Life and Science of Richard Feynman"}
On the title page he wrote: **Notebook Of Things I Don’t Know About**. For the first but
not the last time he reorganized his knowledge. He worked for weeks at disassembling each branch of physics, oiling the parts, and putting them
back together, looking all the while for the raw edges and inconsistencies.
He tried to find the essential kernels of each subject. When he was done
he had a notebook of which he was especially proud.
