## The Problem with “Patent-First” Policies  
Misconception:
- **patent count** with **real innovation output**

While it is true that there is correlation between **patents** and **innovation**, this is not causation.
Are we really supposed to prioritize the creation of patents?

## What Patents are

A protection of the rights of the inventor over their work.
As objects that protect intellectual property, these are:

- Long-winded, full of legal jargon
- Expensive to file due to being a law construct
- Barriers to collaboration and knowledge dissemination

No student would read a patent. Neither would I- very little knowledge value can be found in patents.
In fact, most patents do not become useful.

## Patents are the result, not the cause

:::{.auto-fragment-children}
After a strong research foundation has already been created, patents start to appear due to the commercializability of the new knowledge being produced.

The Bayh-Dole Act is a US law that incentivized the filing of patents by Universities. **Mowery et al.** found that the Bayh-Dole Act:

- caused an increase in commercially useless patents
- did not significantly increase the patent output of top universities as these were already producing patents even before it was incentivized.
:::

## Case Study: U.S. University Patenting Post-Bayh–Dole  
- Patenting rose—but began even *before* the law’s 1980 passage.   
- Newly patenting universities produced patents with fewer citations → lower “value.”   
- Conclusion: **Incentives alone don’t equal quality or success**   

## Firm-Level & SME Evidence: Patents vs Profitability  
SME longitudinal study 2023/2024
- Among tech-firms: patents that survive >6 yrs and with many claims → better profitability.   
- But heavy R&D spending with weak patents reduces that benefit → “over-patenting” is counterproductive.   
- For SMEs: patents boost sales but often not profitability — patents ≠ sustainable business success.   

## What this means  
Bayh-Dole
- Rushing to file patents without a strong research base → many low-value patents  
SME Evidence
- Patent-first policies can drain resources (filing costs, maintenance fees) with little return  
- Real innovation requires: **talent + funding + open research + publications + prototypes + industry collaboration** — patents come *after*  

## Innovation Strategy  
Fund and build strong research programs 
    
> These in turn create good graduate programs that produce innovation power.

Prioritize academic publications, open tools, and open-source designs. 

> Allows a strong knowledge base for students and future researchers

<!-- Develop labs, prototyping capability, and industry collaborations  

> Allows the testing of newer and newer ideas and incubate **important long-term useful ideas** to maturity. These can then be patented. -->

## Conclusion

Patents are *outputs*, not *starting points*

- Patent counts by themselves are a misleading metric  
- Evidence shows that **quality of research** and **depth of ecosystem** matter more than sheer patent numbers  
- For a developing-nation context like ours, the real goal should be **building research capacity** — not chasing patent counts

## Block Callout Testing

Theory: you don't need quarto callouts to generate callouts.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a NOTE callout

> [!NOTE] Test Note 1
> This is a NOTE callout with a custom name

These are called github-flavored markdown (GFM).
They don't work in Quarto anymore, apparently.
They callouts are made as divs and then translated under the hood, since they're pandoc-style.
