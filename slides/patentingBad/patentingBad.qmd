## Slide 1  
### The Problem with “Patent-First” Policies  
- Policy & funding often equate **patent count** with **innovation output**  
- But does this reflect real technological capacity, economic value, or research strength?  
- We examine empirical evidence for a more robust alternative: **research → publications → quality patents**

---

## Slide 2  
### Key Insight from Recent Studies  
- High-quality scientific research underpins commercially valuable patents. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  
- In weak or emerging research ecosystems, most innovations never produce patents. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  
- Early explosion in patent filings does **not** guarantee high-impact or licensable patents. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}

## Slide 3  
### Case Study: U.S. University Patenting Post-Bayh–Dole  
- Patenting rose—but began even *before* the law’s 1980 passage. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}  
- Newly patenting universities produced patents with fewer citations → lower “value.” :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}  
- Conclusion: **Incentives alone don’t equal quality or success** :contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}

## Slide 4  
### Firm-Level & SME Evidence: Patents vs Profitability  
- Among tech-firms: patents that survive >6 yrs and with many claims → better profitability. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}  
- But heavy R&D spending with weak patents reduces that benefit → “over-patenting” is counterproductive. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}  
- For SMEs: patents boost sales but often not profitability — patents ≠ sustainable business success. :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}  

---

## Slide 5  
### What This Means for Emerging-R&D Nations / Universities  
- Rushing to file patents without a strong research base → many low-value patents  
- Patent-first policies can drain resources (filing costs, maintenance fees) with little return  
- Real innovation requires: **talent + funding + open research + publications + prototypes + industry collaboration** — patents come *after*  

---

## Slide 6  
### Recommended “Pipeline-First” Innovation Strategy  
1. Fund and build strong graduate & research programs  
2. Prioritize academic publications, open tools, and open-source designs  
3. Develop labs, prototyping capability, and industry collaborations  
4. Only patent when there is **verified scientific output + demonstrated technical viability + potential industrial value**  

---

## Slide 7  
### Conclusion: Patents are *outputs*, not *starting points*  
- Patent counts by themselves are a misleading metric  
- Evidence shows that **quality of research** and **depth of ecosystem** matter more than sheer patent numbers  
- For a developing-nation context like ours, the real goal should be **building research capacity** — not chasing patent counts
